Advanced Examples
==================

In addition to these basic tutorials, some advanced tutorials are also available:

1. Indirect Reconstruction of unobservable fields: two methodologies are presented to reconstruct unobservable fields from observable ones; one is based on Parameter Estimation + POD with Interpolation and the other on Gaussian Process Regression and POD.
2. State Estimation in Molten Salt Fast Reactors (MSFR) with failing sensors using GEIM and PBDW techniques.
